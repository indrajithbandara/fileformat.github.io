<p>At work we have a slower (1.1 Mbps) internet connection and I don't want to hog it when I need to download a big file.  Fortunately, curl has a --limit-rate option.  For example (should be one line):</p>

<pre>
curl --verbose --output <i>bigfile.tar.gz</i> --limit-rate 3000 <i>http://download.example.com/bigfile.tar.gz</i>
</pre>
