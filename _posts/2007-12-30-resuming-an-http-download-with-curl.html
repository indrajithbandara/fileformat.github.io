<p>I had to download an ISO image to test some new firewall software and it got interrupted halfway through.  Fortunately, curl has a way to continue from where you left out with the <code>-C -</code> option.  A full command line looks like:</p>
<pre>
curl -C - --compressed --output disk.iso http://example/download/disk.iso
</pre>
