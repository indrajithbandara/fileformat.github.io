<p>VMWare didn't start after I installed the latest Etch updates.  The error message is printed to the terminal, which is pretty useless if you're starting it from the GUI.  Anyhow, the fix is pretty easy:</p>
<pre>
apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`
/usr/bin/vmware-config.pl
</pre>
<p>I guess the update had a new kernel and VMWare needed to re-install its hooks.</p>
