<p>I recently had to install VMWare Server on a server that didn't have the GUI bits installed.Â  This is the list of additional packages that need to be installed for VMWare to install:</p>


<pre>
apt-get install psmisc libxrender1 libxt6
</pre>

<p>Then it will install, and the VMs can have GUI even though the host doesn't!</p>
