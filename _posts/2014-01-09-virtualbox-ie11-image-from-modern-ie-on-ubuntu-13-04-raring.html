<p>I needed to test IE11 on Windows 8.1 on my Ubuntu 13.04 (raring) workstation.  Microsoft graciously provides VirtualBox images at <a href="http://modern.ie/">modern.ie</a>, but I was getting the error:</p>

<blockquote>Failed to import appliance VirtualBox VMs/import/IE11 - Win8.1.ovf.</blockquote>

<p>when I tried to import it.  I could not find more detailed messages about why it wouldn't import, but I was able to poke around enough to get it to run.  Here is my workaround:</p>

<ul>
<li>Extract the ova.  This file is in the <code>.tar</code> file format,  with an <code>.ovf</code> and a <code>.vmdk</code> file inside:
<pre>tar -xvf IE11\ -\ Win8.1.ova</pre></li>
<li>Create a new virtual machine in VirtualBox, type=Microsoft Windows, version=Windows 8 (64-bit).  Do NOT add a virtual hard drive. </li>
<li>Once it is created but before you start it, go into the Settings -&gt; Storage -&gt; Controller: SATA and attach the <code>.vmdk</code> file from step 1.</li>
</ul>

<p>Voil√†! A working virtual machine with IE11 on Windows 8.1.  Obviously there is something wrong in the <code>.ovf</code> file, but this is simple enough that it isn't worth trying to figure out what it is.</p>
