<p>I am working on something that needs a list of words, without regard to american vs. british or accents or anything: it just has to be as many words as possible.  There are a whole bunch of <a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/aspell/dict/0index.html">aspell dictionaries</a> available.  First expand the files:</p>
<pre>unzip *.wl</pre>
<p>Then merge into a single list, eliminating duplicates:</p>
<pre>sort --unique --ignore-case *.wl &gt;list.txt</pre>
<p>In additon, I want everything to be UTF-8:</p>
<pre>iconv -f ISO8859-1 -t UTF-8 list.txt &gt;ulist.txt</pre>
<p>Pretty simple.  The merged english word list has 137,883 words.</p>
