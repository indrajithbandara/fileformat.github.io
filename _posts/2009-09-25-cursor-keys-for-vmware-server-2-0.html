<p>I upgraded to VMWare Server 2.0. It has a web-based admin console, which is nice, but isn't as reliable or peppy as the old fat client. The viewer is a browser plug-in, which is okay, but the cursor keys (and page-up, page-down, etc.) do not work (though the ones on the number pad do).</p>



<p>Anyhow, I found the solution! Edit (or create) <code>~/.vmware/config</code> and add the line</p>

<pre>xkeymap.nokeycodeMap=&quot;TRUE&quot;</pre>
