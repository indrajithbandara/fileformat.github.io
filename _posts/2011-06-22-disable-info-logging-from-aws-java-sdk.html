We're using the AWS Java SDK and had an incredibly difficult time figuring out how to disable INFO-level logging.

This is probably particular to our configuration, but I think it is a fairly common setup: Jetty on Ubuntu on EC2.

The problem is that Jetty uses SLF4J, and includes the default slf4j-simple.jar which logs everything.  In order to fix it, you have to remove the symlink in /usr/share/jetty/lib/jsp2.1 and create a new symlink to slf4j-jdk14.jar (and the configure java logging to not log at INFO).

Step by step:
<ol>
<li>cd /usr/share/jetty/lib/jsp2.1</li>
<li>sudo rm slf4j-simple.jar</li>
<li>sudo ln -s ../../../java/slf4j-jdk14.jar slf4j-jdk14.jar</li>
<li>create /usr/share/jetty/webapps/root/WEB-INF/logging.properties with<br />
.level=WARNING</li>
<li>cd /etc/defaults</li>
<li>edit jetty and add:
<pre>
JAVA_OPTIONS=-Djava.util.logging.config.file=/usr/share/jetty/webapps/root/WEB-INF/logging.properties</pre>
</li>
</ol>
