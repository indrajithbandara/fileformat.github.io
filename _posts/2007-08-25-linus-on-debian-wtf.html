<p>So I am reading an <a href="http://apcmag.com/node/7012">interview with Linus Torvalds</a>, and they ask him which distribution he runs, and he <a href="http://apcmag.com/7017/linus_torvalds_talks_future_of_linux_page_3">comes out with</a>:

<blockquote>
...the only distributions I tend to refuse to touch are the "technical" ones, so I've never run Debian, because as far as I'm concerned, the whole and only point of a distribution is to make it easy to install (so that I can then get to the part I care about, namely the kernel), so Debian or one of the "compile everything by hand" ones simply weren't interesting to me.
</blockquote>


<p>Far be it from me to contradict the gospel, but that is just plain wrong.  I used to use Red Hat, and now run Debian.  While I switched because of the licensing, I was amazed at how great apt-get is.  It makes maintenance so simple.  My machines are totally up to date, and I spend almost no time doing it (unlike with Red Hat).  And I am absolutely not a "compile everything by hand" kind of guy either.</p>

<p>This comment really lowered my opinion of him.  It makes me think there's more than a grain of truth in <a href="http://apcmag.com/node/6735/">other sour grapes</a>.</p>
