<p>I got my new machine from the Dell Outlet, so it wasn't configured exactly the way I wanted, but close enough (anyone want a Bluetooth keyboard, cheap?).</p>

<p>The main reason I got it from the outlet was so I could get Windows XP instead of Vista.  I wanted a legit license that I could run in a virtual machine.  I wasn't willing to shell out the additional $'s for the high-end version of Vista that you are allowed to run in a VM.  I didn't realize that Dell would remove the option of getting XP on a new box.  Microsoft is really in control in a way that isn't in a customer's best interest.</p>

<p>I'm running Debian Etch on it.  I was really impressed with how easy it was to install and how everything "just worked".  Video, sound, network, external USB drive, everything.</p>

<p>It is somewhat unfair to compare performance, since I don't know what XP would have been like on the new hardware, but performance is fantastic.   Everything has that nice instantaneous "pop".</p>

<p>I installed VMWare Server (again, hassle-free, though it would have been nice if there was a .deb for it).   I used the VMWare Converter to make an image of my old machine, and it just worked (well, it did after I managed to get Windows XP activated again, grrrrr...).   Maybe it was because my old machine was such a dog, but performance seems excellent: it seems faster in the VM than it did on the real box!</p>

<p>Maybe this is just the honeymoon, but I am really impressed.</p>
