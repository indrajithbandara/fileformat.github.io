<p>One of the things that I missed when I moved from Windows to Linux was the <code>start</code> command, which would launch the correct program for a given file.  Well, add the following line to <code>~/.bashrc</code> to get it:</p>

<pre>
alias start=xdg-open
</pre>


<p>Then either logout/login, or run (the leading dot &amp; space  are important):</p>


<pre>
. ~/.bashrc
</pre>


<p>Now you can launch the appropriate file by doing</p>


<pre>
start artwork.png
</pre>
