<p>The import formats for <a href="http://www.numberplanet.com/">NumberPlanet</a> include a <code>position</code>, which doesn't always exist. To get around this, here's an awk one-liner to add the line number as the postion field:</p>
<pre>
awk '{print $0NR}' infile.csv &gt;outfile.csv
</pre>
<p>If you need to add a comma as well:</p>
<pre>
awk '{print $0","NR}' infile.csv &gt;outfile.csv
</pre>
