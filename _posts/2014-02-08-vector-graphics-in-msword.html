<p>I needed to put a logo in a Microsoft Word document and have it look good:</p>
<ul>
	<li>On screen</li>
	<li>In print</li>
	<li>On screen in a generated PDF</li>
	<li>In print from a generated PDF</li>
</ul>

<p>This proved to be surprising difficult: MSWord doesn't support any standard format, including Microsoft's own <code>VML</code>.  The only one that
I could get to work was <code>WMF</code> and even that took some doing.  I tried <code>EMF</code>, which is supposed to be a more compatible version, and that didn't work either.</p>

<p>Here are the steps I used:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Start with an <code>SVG</code></li>
	<li>Open in InkScape and clear the margins, fit page to image size</li>
	<li>While InkScape can save to <code>WMF</code>, the colors aren't correct, so just resave the <code>SVG</code></li>
	<li>Open in LibreOffice Draw.  Export to WMF</li>
</ol>
