<p>I monitor how often I get visited by the major search engine robots.  GoogleBot and Yahoo Slurp regularly visit and scan thousands of pages every day.  MSNBot never scans more than a couple of hundred pages in a day.</p>

<p>Almost all my search engine referrals are from Google.  None are from MSN.</p>
