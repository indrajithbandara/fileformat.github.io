<p>I've been publishing browser stats for FileFormat.Info and December 2007 marks a couple of milestones:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Firefox (all flavors) passed Internet Explorer (all versions).</li>
	<li>IE7 passed IE6.</li>
</ul>


<p>I suppose FileFormat.Info is a fairly technical site, so this may not be representative of the internet population as a whole.</p>

<p>I am not doing anything browser-specific so it doesn't really affect me directly, but it is good to see real competition.</p>
