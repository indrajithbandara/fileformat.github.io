<p>I got an inexpensive flatbed USB scanner and was disappointed with the bundled (Windows-only) software, so I tried it on Linux.  Debian Etch installs xsane by default, but it would not recognize the scanner.  I tried a whole bunch of things but nothing help, until I accidentally started xsane from a root terminal, and it &quot;just worked&quot;, despite the warning from xsane about running as root.</p>
