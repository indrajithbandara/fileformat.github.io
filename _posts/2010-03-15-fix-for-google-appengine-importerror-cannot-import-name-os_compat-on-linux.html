<p>This is a permissions problems.  Probably because I like to install software as root in /usr/local, rather than in my /home directory.  The solution is to make it readable for everyone:</p>

<pre>
cd /usr/local/google_appengine
sudo chmod -R ugoa+r *
</pre>

<p>I would recommend Google switching from a .zip file to a .tar.gz file (which can have specific permissions in it).</p>
