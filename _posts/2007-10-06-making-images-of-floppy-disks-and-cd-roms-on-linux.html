<p>I have several books that came with floppy disks or CD-ROMs.  I'm worried about whether they'll last and wanted to make copies of them.  It is trivially easy on Linux:</p>


<pre>
dd if=/dev/scd0 of=/iso/book.iso
</pre>


<p>I got a <a href="http://www.troubleshooters.com/linux/coasterless.htm">rawread script</a> that supposedly solves some compatibility problems.  I found that <code>dd</code> worked fine on two disks that the script had problems with.  The script is called with</p>

<pre>
rawread.sh /dev/scd0 >book.iso
</pre>

<p>To mount a image (<code>mkdir /media/iso</code> directory first):</p>

<pre>
sudo mount -o loop book.iso /media/iso
</pre>

<p>For floppies, use  <code>/dev/usb0</code> (I have a usb floppy drive) and <code>.img</code> as the extension.</p>
