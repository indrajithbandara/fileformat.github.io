<p>If you are using Tomcat to serve pages directly (i.e. not through Apache), it will send as server header of <code>ApacheCoyote/1.0</code> which I do not like.  To change this, go into the <code>/etc/tomcat5.5/server.xml</code> file and in the appropriate  tag, add an new attribute:</p>


<pre>
server="NCSA/1.0a6"
</pre>


<p>Or whatever name you would like it to send.  In the same spot, you can add the</p>


<pre>URIEncoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;</pre>


<p>Which is necessary for full Unicode support.</p>
